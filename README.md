This is a repository containing some code samples from my projects. I don't think it is possible to show one's capabilities with out-of-context code, but I tried to show different types of thinking that could be necessary in different situations. In some cases it meant that I traded performance for code readability and vice versa, but I believe that both are important and I, as a developer, should be agile and able to switch between them.
